# Advent of Code 2024
Solutions to the AoC 24 puzzles.

- My goal is to try to use a different language every day...
- That might not work out...
- Probably means using languages I get snooty about (c#, js) and skipping ones that I'm interested in because of a lack of time (asm).
- Also means everything will be pretty ugly...
